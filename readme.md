# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

## First setup

### Clone the repo

Go to https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository and follow the step to clone the repo.

### Install Docker

First you'll need to install docker on your machine : https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/ and follow instructions there.

Don't forget to enable virtualization in the BIOS first : Intel-V, AMD-V, SVM base on your hardware.

### Verify and run the Docker

You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: docker -v and docker-compose -v.

Then, run docker-compose up from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend.

If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database.

Let's test this by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping

If everything is working properly, youâ€™ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register
